## Required Agents

## Inferred Acceptance Criteria
<!-- 3-8 testable acceptance criteria derived from the change request. Format: AC-N: <criterion>.
     test-strategist uses these to populate the Acceptance Criteria → Test Mapping table. -->
- AC-1:
- AC-2:
- AC-3:

## Tasks Not Applicable
<!-- Comma-separated task IDs from tasks.yml that do NOT apply to this change.
     /cdd-new SKILL marks these as `status: skipped` in tasks.yml. -->
- not-applicable:

## Clarifications or Assumptions

## Context Manifest Draft
<!-- Classifier fills this section. In /cdd-new Step 2.3, Claude copies it verbatim into
     specs/changes/<change-id>/context-manifest.md, replacing the scaffold.
     All paths must be repo-relative. Gate enforces Allowed Paths against agent files-read logs. -->

### Affected Surfaces
-

### Allowed Paths
<!-- Union of ALL paths any agent will read. Add change-specific paths below the defaults. -->
- specs/changes/<change-id>/
- specs/context/project-map.md
- specs/context/contracts-index.md

### Agent Work Packets
<!-- One sub-section per required agent (paths must be a subset of Allowed Paths above). -->

#### change-classifier
